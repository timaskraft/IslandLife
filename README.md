# IslandLife

## **Study project for the second module of** [JavaRush - Java University](https://javarush.com/university?utm_source=site&utm_medium=link_menu&utm_campaign=university)

From the mentor:

It is necessary to program an island model with variable parameters, consisting of an array of locations (for example, 100x20 cells). The locations will be filled with vegetation and animals. Animals can: eat plants and/or other animals (if there is suitable food in their location), move (to neighboring locations), reproduce (if there is a mate in their location), starve or be eaten.
